        <h1>GeoMusic : A music-centered social media app</h1>
        <h2>Music discovery redefined</h2>
        <p> GeoMusic is a hot new mobile phone application hitting app stores soon! GeoMusic combines your passion for music with your passion for bragging about your music taste to friends, family, and frankly anyone who cares to listen (or doesn’t). Ever wonder what the person looking way more focused than you across the coffee shop is listening to? Well, wonder no more! GeoMusic allows you to share and view what music you and others around you are listening to, similar to location-based Snapchat stories we use everyday. Simply pin a song, album, or artist you are currently listening to to your current location based story, allowing others to view and rate what music you’re music taste. View location-based music trends, and find new music by visiting new places where other users have posted their local music choices. GeoMusic is a newly formed tech company here in sunny Los Angeles. California, founded and run by a tight-knit group of 5 young music lovers and tech entrepreneurs, aiming to expand GeoMusic’s operations to the entire country and beyond.
